Hi!

This is my helloworld project. The instruction asked me to write about myself. I am a senior one student in RDFZ, Beijing. Today is my first day on Github. I'm excited to explore and make my little contributions to this online society. It's amazing!

I also use this repo as my sandbox to explore features of git and github.
